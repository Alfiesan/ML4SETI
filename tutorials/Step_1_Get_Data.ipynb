    "This first tutorial will explain a little bit on what the data is and where to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update 23 Januar 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has been a huge success and we'd like to thank all of the participants, the winning team `Effsubsee` and the scientific members of the SETI Insitute and IBM. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are beginning to decommision this project. However, it will still be useful as a learning tool. The only real change is that the primary full data set will be removed. The `basic`, `primary small` and `primary medium` data sets will remain. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Update 21 June 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned a lot at the hackathon on June 10-11th and decided to regenerate the primary data set. This is called the `v3` primary data set. The changes, compared to `v2` are: the noise background is gaussian white noise instead of noise from the Sun, the signal amplitudes are higher and the characteristics should make them more distinguishable, and there are only 140k in the full set (20k per signal type), compared with 350k previously (50k per signal type).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `basic` data set remains unchanged from before.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Code Challenge, you will be using the **\"primary\" data set**, as we've called it. The primary data set is   \n",
    "\n",
    "    * labeled data set of 35000 simulated signals\n",
    "    * 7 different labels, or \"signal classifications\"\n",
    "    * total of about 10 GB of data\n",
    "    \n",
    "This data set should be used to train your models. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, we no longer have the full 140,000 data set (51 GB). All of the data are found in the `primary medium` data set below. Additionally , there is the `basic4` data set and the and `primay small` sub set. They are explained below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Data Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data file has a simple format: \n",
    "\n",
    "    * file name = <UUID>.dat\n",
    "    * a JSON header in the first line that contains:\n",
    "        * UUID\n",
    "        * signal_classification (label)\n",
    "    * followed by stream complex-valued time-series data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `ibmseti` Python package is available to assist in reading this data and performing some basic operations for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Warmup Data Set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a second, simple and clean data set that you may use for warmup, which we call the **\"basic\" data set**. This basic set should be used as a sanity check and for very early-stage prototyping. We recommend that everybody starts with this. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Only 4 different signal classifications\n",
    "    * 1000 simulation files for each class: 4000 files total\n",
    "    * Available as single zip file\n",
    "    * ~1 GB in total. \n",
    "       \n",
    "### Basic Set versus Primary Set\n",
    "\n",
    "> The difference between the `basic` and `primary` data sets is that the signals simulated in the `basic` set have, on average, much higher signal to noise ratio (they are larger amplitude signals). They also have other characteristics that will make the different signal classes very distinguishable. **You should be able to get very high signal classification accuracy with the basic data set.**  The primary data set has smaller amplitude signals and can look more similar to each other, making classification accuracy more difficult with this data set. There are also only 4 classes in the basic data set and 7 classes in the primary set. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Primary Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "The `primary medium` was a subset of the full primary data set but it not constitutes the entire data set.  You may want to consider ways to augment this data set in order to create more training samples. Additionally, you could consider splitting each file up into 4 or 5 smaller files and simply build models that accept smaller files. You wouldn't be able to use this for post scores to the Scoreboards, but it would be one way to generate more data. Finally, we hope to one day release the simulation code, which would allow you to generate your own data sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * All 7 signal classifications\n",
    "  * 5000 simulations / class (7 classes = 35000 files)\n",

    "\n",
    "For all data sets, there exists an **index** file. That file is a CSV file. Each row holds the UUID, signal_classification (label) for a simulation file in the data set. You can use these index files in a few different ways (from using to keep track of your downloads, to facilitate parallelization of your analysis on Spark).   \n",

    "# Getting Data from IBM Spark service\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working with IBM Watson Data Platform (or Data Science Experience), you can use either `wget` or `curl` from a Jupyter notebook cell. Or you can use the `requests` library, or similar, to download the files programmatically. (This should work for both the IBM Spark service backend or the IBM Analytics Engine backend.) Simply call `wget` command-line from the shell using the appropriate shell command syntax. The shell command syntax is different for Python kernels versus Scala kernels. Below we show you the Python kernel way, asssuming that the vast majority will use Python. "
