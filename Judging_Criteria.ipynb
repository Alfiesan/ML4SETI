Among the many features of Pixiedust, you can load a `.csv` file into a Pandas or Spark DataFrame and Pixiedust will display that data in your Jupyter notebook. From the display, there is an icon that lets you download the data directly. This is probably the easier option, though you will need to \"`pip install --user pixiedust`\" and restart your kernel.\n",
